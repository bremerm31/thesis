First and foremost I would like to thank Prof. Clint Dawson, my advisor, for all of his support over the many years. None of this would have been possible without his patience, encouragement, and guidance.


Secondly, I would like to gratefully acknowledge the funding that allowed me to pursue this research. Thank you to the Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (Grant DE-FG02-97ER25308) not only for their financial support, but also all the friends I have made along the way. Additionally, I would like to thank the University of Texas at Austin's Donald D. Harrington Graduate Fellowship.


Finally, I would like to thank the many mentors that have made this journey wonderful: Craig Michoski, Cy Chan, John Bachan, Hartmut Kaiser, and many more unnamed friends made along the way.
